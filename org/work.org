** IMPLEMENTING PRODCA-112 (Webhooks not running)
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ticket:       https://themis.atlassian.net/browse/PRODCA-112
   :pull-request:
   :END:

   - [X] Connect with Matthew King on next steps
   - [X] Set up elasticache/redis for simulation
     - This means setting up a VPC, with a public and private
       subnet, internet gateway, and a nat instance with public
       IP configured to forward requests to an elasticache
       (redis) cluster.
   - [X] Document the above
   - [X] Emulate Sentinels
   - [ ] Create some webhooks and see if it works
   - [X] Determine how/when Sentinel is activated
   - [X] Don't enable Sentinel for ProdCA
   - [X] Come up with test plan
   - [X] Connect with Matthew King on validation and strategy
   - [X] Discern why we use kyle's repo for goworker, and if we can
         use the main repo now, or make an upstream push etc.
   - [X] Tear down AWS infrastructure (it's expensive)
   - [ ] Get clarification on my involvement and how far down this
         rabbit hole I should go.
     
   Kyle's goworker repo adds sentinel support. There was an attempt to
   get it added upstream but it was ignored. I devised a solution that
   adds an SSL parameter to the redis config (also added to the
   goworker package by kyle) and uses the new redigo UseTLS option.
   We also need to update which redigo package, and which
   redis-sentinel package we use.
